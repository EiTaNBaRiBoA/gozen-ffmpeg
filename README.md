## GD Extension

This GD Extension gives the tools necessary to use ffmpeg inside of your Godot project. This is part of the [GoZen editor](https://github.com/voylin/GoZen), a video editor which is being developed inside of Godot.

## Features

Main features will be to disassemble videos and put them into Godot as separate entities such as audio, video and subtitles (probably also the stream data). There will also be the functionality to open a renderer which you can feed frames, audio, and subtitles into to generate a video file.

## Requests? 

Leave an issue on this repo.

## Want to contribute?

I'd say, welcome! But you'll need some understanding of C++, possibly together with some ffmpeg knowledge. Don't ask how to learn ffmpeg, as I am still discovering it myself as well.

## TODO:

- Render class; (A way to generate videos by feeding it data)
- Import class. (A way of getting the actual streams from a video file)
